The real highlight about this project is that we can get satisfactory results, that is we can get the robot to balance itself on two wheels without the use of any major algorithms like the sensor fusing kalman filter or the complimentary filter ...all it uses is the ready made arduino PID library and some very basic numbers game which can be understood by anyone who knows how the ADC numbers on the Arduino behave once the ADC is  connected to a sensor...so I wouldn't want any of the more advanced users to scrutinize this project because of the very crude code I am going to provide here for the noobs...
But I believe a more simplistic approach like this is required for folks who want to build something like this but don't know where to start from...even when trying to solve a rubik's cube the first step is to break it apart and put it together with all the pieces in the right place....that is the approach I have used here..so enjoy..
